**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.


Working with data isn't just about getting the numbers right. It involves a lot of responsibility, especially when it comes to ethics and equity. Reflecting on my recent tasks with updating the `product_units` table, I realized that every technical decision can have a broader impact.

First, let’s talk about accuracy. When I had added the `current_quantity` column and updated it with the most recent data from `vendor_inventory`, my main goal was to ensure the numbers were correct. But i need to think beyond just the data itself. If i accidentally misreport inventory levels, it could cause real problems. Vendors might lose out on sales or face unexpected issues, and customers might not find the products they’re looking for, leading to frustration. So, it's crucial to double-check data and use reliable sources. Getting the data right is about more than just accuracy—it's about being responsible and trustworthy.

Equity is another important aspect. When I select and process data, I need to consider who is represented and who might be left out. If my data mainly includes vendors from affluent areas, I will miss out on a complete picture. Smaller vendors or those from less represented communities might not get the attention they deserve. To address this, I should actively seek out diverse sources and ensure my data reflects a wide range of perspectives. This might involve extra effort to gather data from less prominent vendors or making sure our methods don’t favor one group over another unintentionally.

Transparency is also key. People need to understand how to handle data. This builds trust and shows being fair and responsible. Clear documentation and open communication about our processes help stakeholders feel confident in the data they're using. 

In conclusion, while technical accuracy is important, I can’t overlook the ethical and equity aspects of data management. By focusing on accuracy, representation, and transparency, I ensure that my work is not only technically sound but also fair and responsible. This approach helps build a more trustworthy and inclusive data environment, benefiting everyone involved.
